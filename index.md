## Motivation and goals

The DC group aims to support running [Dataverse software](https://dataverse.org) within [containers](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/).
Containers may be used in very different contexts such as development, testing, staging and production.
They also are a way to run the Dataverse software and its dependencies and integrations in enclosed units on different platforms of operating systems and/or hardware.
This working groups aims to include as many perspectives and use cases and make sure the Dataverse community needs are covered.
